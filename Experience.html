            <h2>Reflective Make-AR In-Action - Volunteer Undergraduate Research</h2>
            <h3>Time Spent: January - May 2023 (Freshman Spring)</h3>
            <p>Worked under Dr. Dishita Turakhia to design a program in augmented reality that gave users step-by-step instructions on how to use tools and on making projects. Additionally, the program encouranged in-action and on-action reflection, which encourages users to learn and reflect more on why they use tools in certain ways and how to avoid repeating mistakes. </p>
            <p>My responsabilities included helping with the design and assembly of a PCP board that reads sensors on the tools used with augmented reality. Additionally, I worked on implementing speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality with the Augmented Reality glasses, such that the user can speak to the glasses, producing text that is sent to an AI, which responds via audio output.</p>
