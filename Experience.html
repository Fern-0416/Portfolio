            <h3>Time spent: Summer 2024 (June 2 - Aug 3)</h3>
            <p>I was an exchange researcher for CICATA in Querétaro, México. I designed functional prototype for research project in bladeless wind turbines, used CAD software to create over 20 different pieces satisfying my project and the lab’s needs, and tested the prototype in the field multiple times in simulated streams of water and air</p>

            <h2>Reflective Make-AR In-Action - Volunteer Undergraduate Research</h2>
            <h3>Time Spent: January - May 2023</h3>
            <p>Worked under Dr. Dishita Turakhia to design a program in augmented reality that gave users step-by-step instructions on how to use tools and on making projects. Additionally, the program encouranged in-action and on-action reflection, which encourages users to learn and reflect more on why they use tools in certain ways and how to avoid repeating mistakes. </p>
            <p>My responsabilities included helping with the design and assembly of a PCP board that reads sensors on the tools used with augmented reality. Additionally, I worked on implementing speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality with the Augmented Reality glasses, such that the user can speak to the glasses, producing text that is sent to an AI, which responds via audio output.</p>
