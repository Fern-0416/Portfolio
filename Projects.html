                            In the span of three days, I modeled and constructed a box to display rocks. Inside, there is a pressure sensor that detects if there is an object inside and sends a message to an Arduino. The Arduino, in turn, tells an LED ring hidden under the bottom platform to turn on with specific color and pattern settings. The Arduino also has a digital display with a set of buttons. These buttons can be used to control the LED's and can bring up a pre-programmed text description of the rock inside.

                            I worked in a team of five to build a machine that dispenses liquids from a set of eight containers. It has a digital touchscreen connected to a raspberri pi, which allows you to select a mixed drink. The pi then performs fluid dynamic equations to calculate how long it should turn each valve to obtain precise quantities of each liquid. I worked primarily on the electronics, wiring each valve to a set of transistors to control the 12 volt valves through the pi's gpio pins. I also worked on the programming for the digital display raspberri pi.

                            I worked in a team of three to build a robot that detects, picks up, and sorts green and red blocks in an autonomous matter. I led the electrical and programming component of the project. I wired up a set of PID motor encoders, time-of-flight sensors, color sensors, and servos to a raspberri Pi, which I controlled through an SSH terminal. As for the programming, I tuned the PID controllers, trained a 1080p camera to detect green and red blocks, and used homography techniques to calculate the distance and position of those blocks. Additionally, I programmed a complex game state to allow the robot continously search and pick up blocks for the duration of the game.

                            I programmed my own pipelined processor using Risk V assmebly in a low-level programming language called minispec. The processor takes a 32 bit input, decodes it into an instruction according to the format of Risk V assembly, executes the function, returns the information and writes to memory if necessary. I then used it to optimize an MNIST-dataset neural network inference engine. This allowed me to reduce the total runtime from over 20 Million nanoseconds to 269 thousand nanoseconds.

                            I designed a bot that can play traditional dominoes. It contains one DC motor controlled by an esp32 board. The board sends inputs to an h-bridge that rotates a custom 3d printed lead screw, moving the second motor forwards and backwards to select which domino to knock over. The second motor is a standard servo motor that knocks over the selected domino when given an input from the esp32. When combined with an algorithm that finds the optimal play given any domino board, it can play dominos almost fully autonomously.

It uses induced vortices in water/air currents to perpetuate motion in a system of harmonic oscillation with magnets. The kinetic energy from this oscillation can be harnessed and converted into electrical power. It is a preferable alternative to blade turbines, since it is projected to be significantly less harmful for any ecosystem in comparison to blade turbines. </h3>

                        <h3>As a personal challenge, I was to make a demo for some project related to Virtual Reality in 24 hours. I decided to make a bow that is compatible with the Meta Quest 3 controllers, such that when you draw the string on the real bow, you draw the string on a virtual bow and can shoot an arrow.</h3>
                        <h3>Properties:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The real bow has relatively little tension, so that dry firing the bow doesn't damage it.</li>
                            <li>It is compatible with the game "Apex Construct", a VR archery game</li>
                            <li>The tracking is highly accurate and responsive with regards to the Meta Quest 3's headset</li>
                            <li>Firing the bow creates a resounding vibration, serving as a haptic response that adds to the realism</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Through this class, I learned how to program in C and wrote a series of programs onto an ESP32 board. These include:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mapping code to receive and interpret button/lever inputs and send outputs to a 8x32 LED board</li>
                            <li>Made an ACII "keyboard" that takes 8 levers as an input that represents the 8 bits of an ASCII key, then mapped that ASCII key to a series of LED inputs onto the 8x32 LED board</li>
                            <li>Replicated the internet game Snake: A snake of originally length 3 moves around in the board and is tasked with eating fruits randomly spawned on the board. Every time the snake eats a fruit, it grows by one unit, and if the snake bumps into the boundaries of the board or itself, it's game over. Also implemented a pause button.</li>
                            <li>Streamlined the code from the first program by rewriting the code in Risc V Assembly, such that it runs signifcantly faster and has the same functionality.</li>
                            <li>Recreated Conway's Game of Life, a computer simulation where every pixel turns on or off based on the number of the pixel's neighbors that are currently on. Written entirely in Assembly</li>
